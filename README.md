CONCLUSION:
If designed effectively, chatbots may help prevent misinformation, aid in symptom detection, engender infection-limiting behaviors, and lessen the mental health burden of pandemic response. In a pandemic, no group of people remains unaffected for long. Together, patients, healthcare workers, academics, technology companies, NGOs, and governments can ensure chatbots say the right thing.
